    <p> * Citrus trees should be planted in a sunny and wind-protected area.
        <br> * In the citrus belt (a loosely defined area stretching from southern California to Florida), 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trees can be planted at any time, however, spring is the best time for container-grown plants.
        <br> * Standard-size citrus trees should be spaced 12 to 25 feet apart and dwarf citrus trees should 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be set 6 to 10 feet apart. The exact distance depends on the variety. The bigger the fruit, the 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farther the distance.
        <br> * If the soil is not well-drained, plant the trees on a slight mound to prevent waterlogging.
        <br> * To plant citrus trees inside from seeds, remove the seeds from the desired fruit. Soak the 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeds overnight in water and plant them Â½ inch deep in moist potting soil. Cover the pot with a 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plastic bag or wrap and let it sit in a warm and sunny spot for a few weeks until the seeds 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start to grow. Then, remove the plastic but keep the pot near a warm and sunny window.
