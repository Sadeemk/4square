### How App Is Used
---

Our target user population is for fairly new farmers who need a bit of guidance on how to produce the best crops. Say we have a new farmer who wants a better visualization of their crops as well as more information about the specific crops that they have. The farmer would use our app to accomplish this by first going to the homepage and getting familiar with how our app can assist them. Next, the user would use the "Add a new Field" tab to add the fields they have in their farm. They would enter all of the relevant information and then would be able to see their fields on the homepage. From the homepage, the farmer can then click any specific field and then add crops to that specific field. They will be requred to enter information such as the crop name, planting date, projected harvest date, etc. 

Once they have added a crop to their field, the user will be able to see weather information for that field and crop. This information includes the area's rainfall and irrigation threshold shown in a graph. They can see on the graph the irrigation threshold which lets them know irrigation may not be necessary for that week. There is also a graph which shows future rainfall predictions. 

After all of the users fields and crops are added, they can monitor their crops with help from the graphs provided. They also have the ability to delete a field in case certain fields need to be changed/removed. The user is satisfied after our app provides them an easy way to monitor their crops as well as inform them about their specific crops needs.
