## Project Proposal


### Farm2Fresh
---
Our target demographic is going to be Farmers who are just getting started and maybe need a little bit more knowledge in order to produce the best crop. So many factors come into play when picking a crop: soil, water, sunlight, plot size, temperature...
None of our team members are part of the users population because we have no idea what it takes to manage a farm, choose the right crop, or what tools are neccessary for the varying sizes of farms. 
We plan to use TrefleAPI to get plant data, Fruit and Vegetable Prices dataset that can be found on data.gov to train our recommender systems, and a Storm Prediction Report for climate related solutions


### FindYourActor
---
Our target demographic is going to be for the people involved in casting the actors & actresses to fill a particular role, Whether it's a director looking for inspiration, a casting director who needs certain criteria to be met, or a staffing agency looking to make their job easier, we aim to bring the production team closer to the next big Hollywood star. Our app will give users the ability to search for particular facial traits, or emotions, such as smile intensity, hair color, apparent age, and contact the person who submitted the photo. Actors/Actresses will be able to submit a headshot to our application's platform. We will use a mix of Microsoft's Azure Cognitive APIs in order to get details about the face, and Aloglia's Instant Search API to parse the database instantly for immediate results. Because our app is tailored for Hollywood producers, we feel that we do not fit in the target demographic.
