# Next Steps for Milestone 5, Due Wednesday May 29 @ 12pm

> By the time you turn in this milestone, your app should be nearly finalized. The last few days of the quarter should be used to complete your final project write-up and fix any remaining bugs before your final demo.

### Sadeem 
Implementing the ability to delete a field would be useful in our app. If the user is on `index.html` there should be a button next to the field name that allows the user to remove the field from the app. Additionally, if the user is on `field.html`, he should be able to remove or update the planting for that field. Remember, the _fieldId_ can be found in the URL of the page you are on. Use that when you are making API calls

Additionally, complete the `milestone5.md` write-up as specified by the turn-in instructions: http://courses.pgbovine.net/cogs121/milestone5.htm


### Brandon
Continue to work on styling, the app needs to be polished, every page, every form, etc. Implement the navbar on every page, just make it look like it's ready for deployment. 

### Christian
Get the fine tuning done on `field.html` such as making the charts perfect, give it the eye-candy it deserves. Regarding the slider, tbh that sounds a little complicatedd, but if you want to implement that then be my guest.

### Richard
I will test the entire app and discover where some bugs may be hidden.
