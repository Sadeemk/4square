# Final Turn-In, Due Wednesday June 3 12pm
> By the time you present your final project to your TA for grading during Week 10, you should have all of the functionality in your project finished and fully working. If you have new experimental parts that don't quite work, it's better to leave those out so that your app fully works when your TA tries it. Think about this final in-class demo as showing your product to a complete stranger who is a potential customer. They want a good user experience when first trying your app, so make sure you're not including components that don't fully work.
