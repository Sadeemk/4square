# Next Steps for Milestone 4, Due Wednesday May 22 12pm

> The purpose of this milestone is to start making more progress on the frontend UI portion of your project

### Brandon
Continue to work with the styling you've done, the homepage is not going to change much. Style the field entries to be almost like blog posts, or something blocked, honestly just make bootstrap do everything if you need to

### Christian
Figure out what information is relevant for Agronomic data, then throw it into a chart. Maybe something timeline related. Use [Chart JS](https://www.chartjs.org/)

### Sadeem
Implementing the ability to delete a field would be useful in our app. If the user is on `index.html` there should be a button next to the field name that allows the user to remove the field from the app. Additionally, if the user is on `field.html`, he should be able to remove or update the planting for that field. Remember, the _fieldId_ can be found in the URL of the page you are on. Use that when you are making API calls

### Richard
I will work on visualizing the weather data, and presenting a visual guide that will answer the question: "Should I water my crops today"
