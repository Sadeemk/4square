## Everyone
+ Head to [developer.awhere.com](https://developer.awhere.com/api/get-started) to get an **API Key + Secret** which 
you will use for the remainder of development for our app. 
+ Get an API Development Environment such as [Postman](www.getpostman.com), [Paw](https://paw.cloud), or something similar
+ Test the aWhere endpoints so you know how to build a request, I need your help writing API calls in order to build the app
You've all taken upper division CS courses, you can build an app using RESTful APIs -> they're easy
+ Right now, we will treat our app as if there is 1 sole farmer using it. We will use a SQL database or similar system
to track users, **later**
+ We will worry about dealing with multiple farmers in milestone4, as each person has a lot of work to do

### Sadeem
I need you to allow the farmer to add a Field & Planting, look at the [Fields & Plantings](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/fields-plantings) documentation
to see what crops are even available to users, we are limited to various crops

In this page, ask the farmer to pick from a list of crops, and input various data for [Creating a Field Location](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/fields/create-field)
You will get a response back from the API, basically if there is no error, move the farmer from the signup page to the home page saying 
his/her Field/Plot addition was successful 


### Brandon
On the homepage, the farmer  will have a varied number of [Fields & Plantings](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/fields-plantings).
When the farmer gets to the homepage, there will be a number of plots available on the API. You can `GET` all the fields by following the instructions 
[here](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/fields/get-fields).

Loop through the results and create blocks for every field the farmer has. Let's say the farmer only has 2 plots, sunflower and cotton,
then display 2 blocks with various information, such as `acres`, `name`, and anything else you may find relevant. _There isn't much else a_ `GET` _request offers in this scenario though_

Make these blocks link to Christian's portion of the project


### Christian
Each of the blocks in Brandon's portion will link to your work.

You and I will work with the [Agronomics](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/agronomics) & [Weather](https://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/weather)
APIs to perform our recommendation system. You can work on either the Argonomics side or the Weather side of this portion, but we will need to work 
closely together.

In this page we will provide information such as watering patterns, soil temperature, all the scientific stuff. Additionally, we will be able to predict expected yield, historical data based on crop,
and **much more**
