   <!--- This will be the actual homepage. According to Richard's notes, we'll need current weather at top,
    some fruits in the middle (don't really quite know what to do here), and top stories at the bottom.
    
    //HOW WEIRD, NOT FOR ME. STILL NOT. I WOULD MAKE THEM INTO A IMAGE GRID. YES, THE BUTTONS SHOULD HAVE FRUIT ON THEM.
    //WE CLICK THEM TO GO TO STAT PAGE TO DISPLAY THEIR STATISTICS AND OUR ESTIMATES WHEN TO PICK THEM, WATER THEM, PLANT THEM
    //YEA TRY IT
    i can push again if you want the latest 
    yeah, they don't exist yet
    they don't have borders rn. That blue thing displays if you click one of them
    have you figured out how to make the localhost:3000/-enter name here-   thing?

    orange is just wide
    everything else is a square. i can find a diff orange pic if you want
        want me to make them bigger?
    open your git bash
    go to the file location path
    type npm install
    type node server.js 
    open localhost:3000 in browser
    you mean changes here aren't updating your own saved code? strange, probably a live share thing. It's updating for me,
    but probably cuz i'm the host-->
