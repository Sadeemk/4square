    <!--- This will be the actual homepage. According to Richard's notes, we'll need current weather at top,
    some fruits in the middle (don't really quite know what to do here), and top stories at the bottom.
    
    THE BUTTONS SHOULD HAVE FRUIT ON THEM.
    //WE CLICK THEM TO GO TO STAT PAGE TO DISPLAY THEIR STATISTICS AND OUR ESTIMATES WHEN TO PICK THEM, WATER THEM, PLANT THEM
    they don't have borders rn. That blue thing displays if you click one of them

        Note for group tomorrow: We're trying to figure out how to create html page links similar to how weather and home 
        were made. I.E. typing localhost:3000/weather brings up the weather html, and localhost:3000/home brings up the
        home html. We're thinking about making one for stories and the 4 fruits as well.

    How to see stuff:
    open your git bash
    go to the file location path
    type npm install
    type node server.js 
    open localhost:3000 in browser
    you mean changes here aren't updating your own saved code? strange, probably a live share thing. It's updating for me,
    but probably cuz i'm the host-->
