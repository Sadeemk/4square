    <p> * Strawberry plants require 6-10 hours a day of direct sunlight, so choose  
        your planting site accordingly. 
        * Strawberries are tolerant of different soil types, although they prefer loam. Ideally, begin working in aged manure or compost a couple months before planting. 
        * Soil pH should be between 5.5 and 7. If necessary, amend your soil in advance of planting.
        * The planting site must be well-drained. Raised beds are a particularly good option for strawberry plants.
        * Practice crop rotation for the most success. Do not plant in a site that recently had strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, or eggplant.
        * Strawberries are sprawling plants. Seedlings will send out runners, or ‘daughter’ plants, which in turn will send out their own runners.
        * Make planting holes deep and wide enough to accommodate the entire root system without bending it. 
        * However, don’t plant too deep: The roots should be covered, but the crown should be right at the soil surface.
