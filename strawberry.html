    <p> * Strawberry plants require 6-10 hours a day of direct sunlight, so choose  
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your planting site accordingly.   
        <br> * Strawberries are tolerant of different soil types, although they prefer loam. 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, begin working in aged manure or compost a couple months before planting. 
        <br> * Soil pH should be between 5.5 and 7. If necessary, amend your soil in advance of 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planting.
        <br> * The planting site must be well-drained. Raised beds are a particularly good option
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for strawberry plants.
        <br> * Practice crop rotation for the most success. Do not plant in a site that recently 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, or eggplant.
        <br> * Strawberries are sprawling plants. Seedlings will send out runners, or ‘daughter’ 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plants, which in turn will send out their own runners.
        <br> * Make planting holes deep and wide enough to accommodate the entire root system 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without bending it. 
        <br> * However, don’t plant too deep: The roots should be covered, but the crown should 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be right at the soil surface.
