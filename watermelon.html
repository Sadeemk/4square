    <p> * If you live in warmer climes, you can sow seeds directly outdoors, but wait until the soil 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature warms to at least 70°F to avoid poor germination.
        <br> * Watermelon vines are very tender and should not be transplanted until all danger of frost 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has passed. (To be safe, wait at least two weeks past your last frost date.)
        <br> * If you are in a cooler zone, start seeds indoors about a month before transplanting. 
        <br> * Amend soil with aged manure, seaweed, and/or compost before planting. Watermelons are heavy 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeders. Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting.
        <br> * Watermelons prefer a soil pH between 6 and 6.8.
        <br> * Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sun’s heat longer. Space the plants about 2 feet apart in a 5-foot-wide hill. 
        <br> * If you’re growing in rows, space 6 feet by 6 feet apart. 
        <br> * Watermelons like loamy, well-drained soil. Handle them gently when you transplant. 
        <br> * After you transplant, cover the plants with row covers to keep pests at bay. You’ll remove the row 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covers when you see both male and female flowers on the vine.
