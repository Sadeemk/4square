### Farm2Fresh
--
Between the two proposals that we had, we talked it out and decided to stick
with Farm2Fresh because we found it was easier to get data for it. We decided
which ideas on wanted to display, such as the soil quality, plot size, and
picking time. We cahnged our API to aWhere, an API meant for agriculture and
full of temperature data.

Our homepage is relatively the same like the paper prototype. We all liked
having the farm plots in the homepage and relevant news beneath it. For our
fruit analysis we have changed it to give each crop their own page. We also
deleted sections like the big FAQ page (rather implementing Q bubbles on each
page) and the 'creative ideas' pages.
