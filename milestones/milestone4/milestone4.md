### Farm2Fresh
--

The screenshots of our UI have improved in a few noticeable ways.
We have updated the UI of our homepage. We removed the old 4Square 
logo and added the app name in the navbar. There is also an a quick
paragraph on the homepage about what Farm2Fresh offers followed by 
the users farms underneath it. There are a few farms that are shown 
underneath this and they are clickable links that take you to that 
specific crop. When you click on one of them, it takes you to a page 
about that crop that shows weather information. In the form of a graph 
we have rainfall data.


For User Action 1 (Adding a field), we can now add crops onto the website so it reflects what the farmer owns. This was implmeneted through a field form, which records the inputs and then submits the request to AWhere.com. This should lead to a successful request and add your field on the bottom of the homepage. Before it used to print request denied or request successsful. This week we have also linked it to the homepage. The terminal can display the accessed information if successful and the field is actually added to the homepage.

User Action 1 is accessed by the 'add a field' on the nav bar. Valid field id ranges from our crops of oat, sunflower, cotton, and canola. For farm id, type in the name of your farm. For latitude and longitude, input the location of your crop in order to receive their accurate weather report. To view this, hit the back button to return to the homepage.

For User Action 2 (Displaying crop information), we can now display weather information for each individual crop and tell the farmer how to irrigate it. In the code, we display a paragraph explaining PPET and the future rainfall, and show the corresponding graphs for each crop. The graphs are generated by creating an Ajax call to AWhere.comâ€™s api, which holds weather reports based on location. We then display it using chart.js to create a line chart. This is a nontrivial implementation given that we pull the data ourselves and use the two graphs to help the farmer in making decisions about whether to irrigate that week or not.

To access each field, click on the field tabs on the bottom of the homepage. They will take you to field.html, which will display the data.
