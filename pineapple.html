    <p> * <b>Plant Location:</b> Your pineapple needs bright light or full sun for most of the day. It can 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handle a little bit of shade as long as there’s plenty of light. Keep the plant away from 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freezing temperatures. The large pineapple plant in the photos spends the winter in an unheated
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Carolina basement, in a warm sunny nook created by a large south-facing window.
        <br> * <b>Water and Fertilizer:</b> Overwatering and overfeeding are the two best ways to kill a pineapple 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plant. Water only as needed, and feed the plant about once a month with a balanced organic 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fertilizer at no more than regular strength. Keep your pineapple plant lightly moist, and 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never let it become waterlogged or bone dry.
        <br> * <b>Pineapple Growing Season:</b> Your pineapple plant will do most of its growing during the warm 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seasons and will slow down when the days get short.
        <br> * <b>Pineapple Blooming:</b> Like other bromeliads, it can be very difficult to get a pineapple to 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bloom, and it’s not likely to bloom or produce fruit for 2-3 years. If it doesn’t bloom on its
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own, one popular way to induce blooming is to expose the pineapple plant to ethylene gas by 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enclosing your pineapple plant in plastic with a few overripe apples for a few weeks during 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the winter. As the apples decompose, they release ethylene which stimulates flowering.
        <br> * <b>Harvesting Pineapples:</b> Once your pineapple plant flowers, it takes several months to grow 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit. Smaller plants will produce smaller pineapples, but they’re just as yummy! Pick the 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pineapples when they are evenly ripe and golden yellow.
        <br> * <b>Growing More Pineapples:</b> All of those new pineapples can be rooted to make more plants. When 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you harvest your pineapples, look at the base of the fruit for small baby shoots. Harvest your 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pineapple carefully, leaving these shoots to grow a little. They can then be gently removed and 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted in their own pots.
