### List of Source Code Files
---

list of all source code files in your GitHub project repository that your team members wrote, along with a brief description of what functionality is implemented in each file. This should include all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant code files that you wrote.

Each source code file has a brief paragraph written in comments at the top of the file describing what functionality is implemented in that file. You should also write brief comments to describe non-trivial functionality elsewhere throughout your source code files so that your TA can get a high-level sense of what each part of your code does. (You don't need to comment every function or block of code in great detail; general high-level comments are fine.)
