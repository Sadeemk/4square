### Team Members & Contributions

#### Richard Pena
I wrote the structure of the application, including functionality and API calls. I wrote the NodeJS + Express server that would handle all internal and external AJAX requests. Any call written to the aWhere API that we used was written by me. I generated the template to be used with Chart.js that Christian took advantage of. Additionally, I created all forms that were used to interact with the API. I demonstrated to my team how to use POSTMAN with our API so they could develop locally, and allowed user selected data to be passed around the app via query string or in the body of every request.

### List of Source Code Files
---

list of all source code files in your GitHub project repository that your team members wrote, along with a brief description of what functionality is implemented in each file. This should include all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant code files that you wrote.

Each source code file has a brief paragraph written in comments at the top of the file describing what functionality is implemented in that file. You should also write brief comments to describe non-trivial functionality elsewhere throughout your source code files so that your TA can get a high-level sense of what each part of your code does. (You don't need to comment every function or block of code in great detail; general high-level comments are fine.)
